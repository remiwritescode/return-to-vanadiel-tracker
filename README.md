# Return to Vana'diel Campaign Notifier

I spent way too much time in my youth in the world of Vana'diel and love going back when it's free! However, I always miss the campaigns and have a habit of finding they happened a couple weeks before I go to check if one is coming up. To get around this, I figured I could scrape the page to get the date and notify myself when one is coming!

This script hits the URL that returns the configuration XML that populates the page and notifies you in the event a campaign is coming up from a basic macos system dialogue on whatever the current app is.

Yeah, if I cared more I could make a little web app out of it that accepts emails to send email notifications to people or something, but this works for my needs. It only works on macos because of the osascript alert implementation.

I run it daily on a crontab ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

### Requirements
- MacOS
- Ruby

### Debugging

If you add this to a crontab and it's not working, I found that it sends your user mail that you can read to see the error message!

`cat /var/mail/<your_cron_user>`

Also, while the env for running the script in a terminal works, I had to specify the executable when running it in cron to get my gems loaded.
